  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>Hey there! I'm Mikey Cacciatore, a passionate programmer with a knack for blending creativity with technical expertise. I've been tinkering with code since the early 2000s, back when MySpace ruled the web and personal blogs were all the rage. Over the years, my journey through programming has been as dynamic as the ever-evolving internet landscape.</p>
  
  <h2> Early Roots and Diverse Experience</h2>
  
  <p>My programming journey started with HTML, CSS, and basic Java, primarily for customizing MySpace pages and crafting personal blogs. Alongside, I dabbled in RPG Maker, fine-tuning games by editing RGSS2 code, which sparked my love for problem-solving through programming.
  
    During my college years at Syracuse University, where I earned a Bachelor's degree in Philosophy, I delved into logic courses that laid a solid foundation for understanding the intricacies of programming languages. This background made transitioning into scripting for live-streamed D&D sessions seamless. I utilized JavaScript to enhance viewer experiences with real-time spell tracking, dynamic health management, and captivating animated GUIs tailored to the unfolding adventures.</p>
  
    <h2> Professional Growth and Academic Pursuits</h2>
  
  <p>Before immersing myself fully in the world of programming, I owned a business and collaborated with esteemed companies such as Tesla, Allstate, and Hertz. These experiences not only sharpened my business acumen but also fostered a deep appreciation for the intersection of technology and real-world applications.
  
    Now, armed with a Master's in Computer Science in progress, I'm honing my skills in advanced JavaScript and gearing up to explore the full spectrum of full-stack development. Python, with its versatility and robust capabilities, is next on my list of languages to conquer.</p>
  
    <h2> Connect with Me</h2>
    <p>I'm always up for discussing new projects, sharing insights on programming, or just geeking out over the latest tech innovations. Let's connect and collaborate on turning your ideas into beautifully functional realities.</p>
